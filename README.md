This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network ideal for time-series forecasting. In financial markets, accurately forecasting stock prices is a challenging task due to market volatility and the sequential nature of stock data. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging LSTM’s ability to learn long-term dependencies, making it an excellent choice for financial forecasting.
